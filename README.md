# Hi there, I'm Mohamed 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a builder, developer, and storyteller focused on creating tools that help people grow. I work across mobile apps, backend systems, and AI-driven features, currently building **Deen n' Dunya**, **Sanad+**, and a suite of productivity and community-centered tools under **MK Builds**.

I turn raw ideas into fully functional MVPs extremely fast — complete with clean UI, backend architecture, and real user-ready systems. I love shipping quickly, learning from first principles, and turning ideas into real, useful products.

**Philosophy:** Build with purpose, ship quickly, and constantly refine using data, design, and first-principles thinking.

## 💡 Beyond Code
I'm passionate about helping people grow — spiritually, mentally, and personally — through tools that are simple, modern, and genuinely useful. I balance building apps with community organizing, personal development, branding, design, and youth mentorship.

**Fun fact:** I've built entire apps, systems, and brands solo — while running community programs and managing academic commitments.

## 🤝 Let's Connect
I'm open to selective collaborations, especially projects that combine tech, personal growth, and community impact. I love conversations about app building, entrepreneurship, personal growth, Islamic education, and community systems.

I'm also open to mentoring youth and beginners in tech.
