# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mohamed

### Builder • Developer • Storyteller

I turn raw ideas into fully functional MVPs — complete with clean UI, backend architecture, and real user-ready systems.

Currently building **[Deen n' Dunya](https://deenndunya.org)**, **Sanad+**, and a suite of productivity tools under **[MK Builds](https://mkbuilds.dev)**

*"Build with purpose, ship quickly, and constantly refine using data, design, and first-principles thinking."*

## 💡 Beyond Code

I'm passionate about helping people grow — spiritually, mentally, and personally — through tools that are simple, modern, and genuinely useful.

I balance building apps with community organizing, personal development, branding, design, and youth mentorship.

**Fun fact:** I've built entire apps, systems, and brands solo — while running community programs and managing academic commitments.

---

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm open to **selective collaborations**, especially projects that combine tech, personal growth, and community impact.

I love conversations about: **App building** • **Entrepreneurship** • **Personal growth** • **Islamic education** • **Community systems**

Also open to **mentoring youth and beginners in tech**.
